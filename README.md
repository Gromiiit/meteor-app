# Meteor-app

## Prerequisites
Node v22.14.0

Meteor v3.3

## Run project locally
meteor npm install

meteor run --settings server/settings.json

## My Approach to the Exercise
1) Didn't use any of accessible LLMs.
2) For each of a additional requirement I approached them as if it were being introduced incrementally, reflecting a development process.

## Explanation of implementation
Due to time constraints, some trade-offs were made.

1) Not using linter, some of imports might be unnecesary and some trailing whitespaces may appear.
2) Some part of a main app could be separated to own components. However given the size of the project, it didnâ€™t seem that important to me.
3) Not using typescript, same as previous point due to size of a project didn't seem that important to check types and user input check.
4) Lastly download button is repeating itself, should be added as separete component or part of a hook.
